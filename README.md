This is a personal birthday website which I created as a special digital gift for my sister.
The website is built using HTML and CSS and focuses on clean layout, visual storytelling, and responsive design. It includes images, GIFs, and hover effects to create a fun and memorable user experience.
This project helped me practice real-world frontend skills such as project structuring, asset management, styling, and deployment.
